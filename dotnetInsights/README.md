# .NET Insights

An extension for drilling into .NET MSIL and Jitted ASM for managed executables (PE Files). This is a cross platform extension that works on OSX and Windows. Future support will come around for Linux.

Note that currently only x64 assembly will be generated. Future support will come around for cross architectures like arm64, arm and x86.

# Overview

## Usage

1. Select a managed PE file. This is generally a .NET DLL under the `${workspaceFolder}/bin/Release/application.dll`
2. By default the .NET MSIL will be dumped and opened. Once this is done, the IL+ view on the side will have a list of types and methods for the DLL.
3. Click on a method to dump the Optimized ASM generated by the .NET Jit. Optionally right click to dump either the .NET Tier 0 Jitted code or diff Tier 0/Tier 1.

## Notes

Dumping the ASM for a Debug built DLL will **always** dump debuggable code (Tier 0).

The first startup of the extension will download two private builds of the .NET runtime 3.1 and 5.0. This is expected to take ~5 minutes to setup.
